#### About me:
_I am 23 years old and live in Moscow. My work in IT started a year ago when I got an offer for an IT researcher position at Yandex. A lot has changed in a year, I realised I wanted to be a front-end developer. I am motivated by the limitless possibilities that are presented to you when you start writing code._

##### Code example:

_7 kyu kata for example Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms._
_In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell)._
_Example: (input --> output) "ATTGC" --> "TAACG" "GTAT" --> "CATA"_

```
function DNAStrand(dna){
  let result = ''
  for (let i = 0; i < dna.length; i++) {
    if (dna[i] == 'A') result += 'T';
    else if (dna[i] == 'T') result += 'A';
    else if (dna[i] == 'C') result += 'G';
    else if (dna[i] == 'G') result += 'C';
  }
  return result;
}
```
